JOHN GUTTAG: Hello, and welcome back to 600.

1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,790
We&#39;re about to move away from probability, but before I do, I can&#39;t

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,020
resist looking at a probability question that has stumped many

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,219
supposedly clever people, the so-called Monty Hall problem.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,570
The problem is based on a television game show called Let&#39;s Make A Deal.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,360
The show was popular in the 1960s and &#39;70s.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,560
Imagine that you&#39;re on that show, and you&#39;re given the choice of three

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,510
doors, one, two, or three.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,600
By the way, the people who were on the show dressed up in silly costumes in

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,580
the hope it would attract the idea of the host, Monty Hall, who would invite

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,900
them up front to play.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,430
Behind one of the doors is a car.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,810
Now, OK, maybe it wasn&#39;t this car in the 1960s.

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,230
And behind the other two doors are goats.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,020
The contestant is asked to choose a door.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,580
After--

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,470
let&#39;s assume you&#39;re the contestant--

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,880
after you have chosen a door, the door remains closed.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,230
Monty Hall, who knows what is behind the door, now has to open one of the

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,350
two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have a goat behind it.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,080
After Monty opens a door with a goat, he will ask you, the contestant, to

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,340
decide whether you want to stay with your first choice, say door number

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,050
one, or switch to the last remaining door, in this case, door number two.

23
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,820
What should you do?

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,380
Well, the audience will shout all sorts of advice, but you should ignore

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
it and figure it out yourself.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,930
The problem has been around for quite a time, and the literature suggests

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,730
that most people get it wrong the first time.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,510
In 1991, Parade Magazine published a correct solution to the problem, and

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,920
approximately 10,000 readers wrote to claim that the magazine got it wrong.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,540
By the way, among those 10,000 readers, 1,000 claimed to have PhDs.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,800
I hope none of them were from MIT.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,120
If you were taking this class at MIT, you would now have the opportunity to

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,670
play the game for fabulous prizes.

34
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,030
Since you&#39;re not, you&#39;ll have to settle for my working the

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,360
probabilities.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,560
I&#39;m going to do that in two different ways.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,690
So let&#39;s look at the first way.

38
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,610
Assume that without loss of generality, you choose door one.

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,170
Now, Monty will open another door, and again, let&#39;s assume without loss of

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,320
generality, he opens three.

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,890
And there stands the goat.

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,490
When the game started, it was equally likely that the car was behind door

43
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,665
one or two.

44
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:38,160
Because we know it wasn&#39;t behind three.

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,060
It was placed at random.

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,440
So, one and two are equally likely.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,460
Therefore, it doesn&#39;t matter.

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,260
You can switch or not switch, and the odds will be the same, 0.5.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,340
Sound plausible to you?

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,860
It does to most people, but in fact, the argument is flawed.

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,040
Let&#39;s look at the problem a different way.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,540
Again, you&#39;re the player and you make a choice.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,470
With the probability of 1/3, the choice is correct.

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,300
That means that if you could choose the other doors, the probability of

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,600
the goat or the probability of the car being behind doors two or three, the

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,950
remaining one is 2/3.

57
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,590
So with probability a third, you are correct, and the car is indeed behind

58
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,730
the door you chose.

59
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,580
But with probability 2/3, you were wrong, and the car was behind one of

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,180
the other doors.

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,240
Now comes the key moment.

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,640
Monty opens the door that he knows does not contain the car.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,870
Note that this choice is not independent of the

64
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,950
choice made by the player.

65
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,600
The player has made a choice, say door one, forcing Monty to

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,680
choose two or three.

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,950
He does not want to open the door with the car, because then the game would

68
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,470
be over, so he opens the other door.

69
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,320
So in fact, by switching, the contestant has a 2/3

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
probability of winning.

71
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,670
It&#39;s tricky.

72
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,290
When we work probabilities, we always have to think about whether or not we

73
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,060
are looking at independent events or related events.

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,750
To drive this point home, I want to look at some code that

75
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,050
simulates the game.

76
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,310
So, here&#39;s the game.

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,610
I&#39;m going to simulate it for 100 trials.

78
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,390
And I&#39;m going to pass in this choose function, and we&#39;re going to look at

79
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,450
two different ways that we might choose which door to open after the

80
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,950
contestant has made a choice.

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,960
We&#39;ll look at the number of times the contestant wins--

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,790
the number of wins by not switching-- we&#39;ll look at the number of times a

83
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,270
contestant wins by switching, and the number of times a contestant doesn&#39;t

84
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,470
win it all.

85
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,320
The door will be behind one, two, or three, and the guests will have to be

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
one, two, or three.

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,910
So for t in range numTrials, we first choose a place to

88
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,740
put the car at random.

89
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,830
The contestant then makes a guess at random.

90
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,830
We then call the choose function, this one, which takes as an argument the

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,400
guess and the door behind which the prize exists, because remember Monty

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,130
knows that, and it makes a choice.

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,670
If two open is a prize door, then there&#39;s no win.

94
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,770
Of course, if we play the game according to Monty Hall rules, this

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,330
will never happen, because he won&#39;t open the prize door.

96
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,890
But we&#39;re going to explore the other option where he chooses at random.

97
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,130
Otherwise, if the guess is the prize door, the contestant wins by sticking.

98
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,660
Otherwise, by switching.

99
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,010
And then, we&#39;ll return the number of stick wins and the

100
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,910
number of switch wins.

101
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,270
Here are two possible choose functions.

102
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,180
The first one is the one that is used on Let&#39;s Make A Deal.

103
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,100
Essentially, Monty is just choosing the door that the contestant didn&#39;t

104
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,530
choose and that has a goat.

105
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,650
The other possibility is a random choice, where Monty will say, if the

106
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,760
guest door is one, we&#39;ll open either two or three.

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,130
So perhaps, it might be the car.

108
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,860
Otherwise, one or three, else one or two.

109
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,830
Finally, we&#39;ll have a function that displays the results.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,430
I&#39;m showing you this, because it&#39;s using yet another pylab plotting

111
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,720
function, pylab.pie, which produces a pie chart.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,230
OK.

113
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,120
Let&#39;s go over to the code window and run it.

114
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,670
So, we&#39;ll first run it the way the game works calling it with Monty

115
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,780
choose, and we&#39;ll display it.

116
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,390
And we&#39;ll produce another figure in which we make the random choice, and

117
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,960
we&#39;ll display it.

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,200
Well, notice that if we play by the game rules, indeed, it&#39;s the case that

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,300
you double your odds by switching, shown by this pie chart.

120
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,090
Course since there&#39;s randomness, it&#39;s not exactly 1/3,

121
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,690
2/3, but pretty close.

122
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,530
On the other hand, if we play the game randomly, then in fact, it doesn&#39;t

123
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,560
matter, because an independent decision is being made, and indeed,

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,580
the odds are unchanged by switching.
